# To-do-web
I am currently having trouble adding new features to this such as deletion of tasks and striking tasks that have been checked since it clashes with other css features. Gonna add them as soon as I figure it out and learn more. Any help would be appreciated. Thanks for checking this out. 
I understand my projects aren't very visually appealing as they should be but I'm trying my best here.

Made some improvements to the style of the page.
